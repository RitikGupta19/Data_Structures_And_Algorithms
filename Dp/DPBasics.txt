 * When in a problem you need to find the following things:
 * 1. Find the total number of ways
 * 2. Best possible solution
 * 3. Min/Max steps to do this
 * 
 * This means that this problem is related to Recursion.
 * If a problem is related to recursion it can be done with DP.
 * 
 * Some basic steps for each DP problem:
 * 1. Try to represent the problem always in terms of index.
 * 2. Try to do all the possible stuff with those index according to the problem statement.
 * 3. If total number of ways asked: then sum all the possible stuffs.
 * 4. Find min: find min. of all the stuffs (similar for the max)
 * 
 * Following above steps you would be able to write any recurrence relation.
 * If that is written you will be able to solve the DP problem.
 * 
 * Staircase Problem:
 * We need to find the total number of ways we can reach from 0th step to the nth step.
 * We can take 1 step, 2 steps at a time.
 * Since we need to find the total number of ways = DP problem.


 There are 6 types of problems in DP which can help you solve any DP question for 2D / Grid based problems.
 1. Count Paths
 2. Count paths with obstacles
 3. Min. Path sum
 4. Max. Path sum
 5. Triangle
 6. 2 Start points 

 Subsets/Subsequences problems:
 Subsets: order does not matter
 Subsequences: subset with order as well.
